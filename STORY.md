## a little story
ive always liked computers, except for that one time i went to a school which was supposed to be all about them and i **HATED** it so i went to a school which was not all about computers and i loved it.

### how i started
i first started serious coding with a simple and very ugly html website, then i stopped (wow very interesting)

### java era #1 + trying out react
in august 2023 i started making a minecraft plugin called metroverse. it had a good 3 month run of active development but while i was developing it i was also looking into react development, but i never got far into it because i didn't have any ideas.

### nauplia versions 1-3 and why they all failed
in december 2023 i had the best idea of my career yet (11-09-24): nauplia, an app which connected to argo (every italian school's online grading system) and would have leaderboards on grades, absences, late entrances, and overall be a social media. sadly that idea was too good to be true, as the api was basically not there (not really, but it was just too difficult to maintain and too weird generally), so after about 2 months of generating non-existant hype, i decided to "temporairly" halt nauplia development to work on other projects.

### luverz and fantaszn
luverz. this was supposed to be a dating app for my school's students only, but after another 2 months of development i felt burnt out and stopped working on that too. on july 1st, i had the idea what would end up being the most finished project of my career yet, fantaszn. i started developing it on july 4th and it started as a way to track points for the fantasummer game, but ended up being the best way to play with multiple seasons so you're not forced to just play in summer. so here we are now (11-09-24) and fantaszn is pretty much finished.

### java era #2
on about september 2024, a new two-week minecraft phase started, and at the time i was intrigued by servers like starnet and hideaway, so i wanted to do similar custom stuff like them, so i started working on moonstar, which added stuff like custom furniture, custom wearables, and custom enchants. i was working on custom dialogue, but while i was working on it the server died so i never got to finish it. while i made the plugin for the server, its real purpose was for me to learn more about minecraft, spigot and java.

### fantasummer (fantaszn v2) and more
march 2025. "what if fantaszn was good", i said. so i reworked it from scratch, except now anyone can create a "group" and make their own challenges! same concept as before, just more customizable and with a much better ui. i also started working on "sticky", a simple app similar to figjam but it only had sticky notes and it was really bad. recently (08-07-25) i started working on sticky v2 and its even worse i mean the ui is better but it does absolutely nothing. i might work on it more idk

### random projects
after "giving up" on fantasummer and sticky (which should lowkey be considered part of these random projects), i decided to work on a couple random projects to build experience and solve stupid problems i have. first was tunepilot, a local music player with discord integration. imma be honest i built this specifically so my friends could see the unreleased music i listen to. i based it on a design that i made in figma like a year earlier, but i never finished it because working with a lot of files is boring, and there's just no good discord javascript apis. then i designed mezzoparty (dumb name ik), a react native app (my first react native project that made it past the initial template) consisting of a bunch of games that you can play with your friends while being together physically. stuff like impostor, truth or dare, and more. i never finished it because i probably need a game engine for some stuff and idk how to work that. i might work on it some more one day.

### berto.life
around the luverz and fantaszn era i made a little portfolio website to host my work, however i never used it and it was pretty stupid. but one day, i decided to buy the domain berto.life for like 2 euros and i remade that portfolio and then i changed the whole direction of it and swapped that freshly remade portfolio (which is now [here](https://old.berto.life)) with a new simpler one (which you can find [here](https://berto.life)).

### matcha
what if there was a dating app for minors? YES THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE WORST IDEA OF ALL TIME BUT HEAR ME OUT. only available for high school students (13-19 years old) with algorithms to specifically prevent 19 year olds matching with 13 year olds. students will have to verify in one way or another, to make sure that they are actually students and not 50 year olds. in a hypothetical scenario, the app would function basically exactly like hinge, with various prompts that people can respond to in order to start a conversation which has a 3 day timer (the idea is that you have to get to know the other person quickly and get their number or instagram). hopefully one day i'll finish it. i also have a working react native prototype, auth and a simple backend
