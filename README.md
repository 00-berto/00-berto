# berto

- 🪪 I am berto, world's greatest italian developer.
- 🗣️ I'm currently working on NAUPLIA, my most ambitious project yet. (nauplia.vercel.app)
- 📒 Along with NAUPLIA, I am learning JavaScript and TypeScript.
- ☕ I CAN kinda use Java and I am pretty good at making Minecraft Java plugins.
- 🏫 I do all of this while being a student, so my schedule is not that good.
- 📧 Feel free to email me at walters.cooking.partner@gmail.com (or berto@nauplia.net when i get the domain)
- 🎉 Fun fact: NAUPLIA has heavily affected my mental health and view of life.
