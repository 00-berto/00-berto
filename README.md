# berto

- 🪪 I am berto, also known as mvdev somethimes.
- 🗣️ I'm currently working on NAUPLIA, the world's first social network.
- 📒 Along with NAUPLIA, I am learning javascript and typescript.
- ☕ I CAN kinda use java and I am pretty good at making minecraft java plugins.
- 🏫 I do all of this while being a student, so my schedule is not that good.
- 📧 Feel free to email me at walters.cooking.partner@gmail.com (or berto@nauplia.net when i get the domain)
- 🎉 Fun fact: NAUPLIA has heavily affected my mental health and view of life.
